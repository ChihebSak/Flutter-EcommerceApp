E-commerce Mobile App with Flutter and MERN RESTful API
Welcome to the E-commerce Mobile App GitHub repository! This project is a full-fledged e-commerce mobile app developed using the Flutter framework, backed by a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) RESTful API. This README will provide an overview of the project's architecture and explain the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern used in this project.

Project Architecture
Frontend (Mobile App)
The frontend of this e-commerce app is built using the Flutter framework. Flutter is a versatile, open-source UI software development toolkit developed by Google, making it a great choice for building cross-platform mobile applications.

Key components and technologies used in the mobile app include:

Dart: The primary programming language for building the Flutter app.
Flutter Widgets: Customizable UI components and widgets to create a user-friendly interface.
State Management: The project employs MVVM architecture for efficient state management.
RESTful API Integration: Communication with the backend server via HTTP requests to fetch and post data.
Third-Party Libraries: Various Flutter packages and libraries are used for functionalities such as navigation, authentication, and UI enhancements.
Backend (MERN RESTful API)
The backend of the e-commerce app is based on the MERN stack, which is a popular choice for building robust web applications. Here's an overview of the backend components:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store product information, user profiles, and other data.
Express.js: A web application framework for building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic.
React: A JavaScript library used for building a dynamic and responsive admin dashboard for managing products, users, and orders.
Node.js: The server-side JavaScript runtime responsible for handling HTTP requests and connecting with the MongoDB database.
MVVM Architecture
The E-commerce Mobile App is designed using the MVVM architectural pattern, which stands for Model-View-ViewModel. Here's how MVVM is implemented in this project:

Model: The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. In this project, it includes data models for products, user profiles, orders, and other essential entities. These models encapsulate the data and operations related to them.

View: The View is responsible for the user interface and presentation. In the Flutter app, this is where the UI components are defined, including screens, widgets, and layouts. The View observes changes in the ViewModel and updates the UI accordingly.

ViewModel: The ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It contains the application's business logic and state. It listens to changes in the Model and exposes data and methods that the View can bind to. The ViewModel ensures that the View remains agnostic of the data source and is kept clean and maintainable.

MVVM promotes separation of concerns, making the codebase more organized, testable, and easier to maintain. It also facilitates data binding, enabling automatic updates in the UI when the underlying data changes.
